## Frontend

The frontend of the application is developed using Vite and React. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the notes. The frontend integrates with the backend API to send requests and receive responses for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting notes.

### To run the frontend, follow these steps:

Navigate to the frontend directory: cd frontend.
Install the dependencies: npm install.
Start the development server: npm run dev.
Make sure the backend server is running before starting the frontend application.
