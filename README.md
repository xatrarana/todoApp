#Note Application This is a simple web application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete notes. The application consists of a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and a Vite React application for the frontend. The application does not use a database and instead stores the notes in an array.

##Backend The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides a RESTful API to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes. The backend API is responsible for processing the incoming requests from the frontend, performing the required operations on the notes array, and sending back the appropriate response.

###To start the server, follow these steps: Clone the repository. Navigate to the backend directory: cd backend. Install the dependencies: npm install. Run the tests to ensure everything is set up correctly: npm run test.

##Frontend

The frontend of the application is developed using Vite and React. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the notes. The frontend integrates with the backend API to send requests and receive responses for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting notes.

###To run the frontend, follow these steps:

Navigate to the frontend directory: cd frontend. Install the dependencies: npm install. Start the development server: npm run dev. Make sure the backend server is running before starting the frontend application.

##Usage Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the Note Application in your browser. The application allows you to perform the following actions:

Create a new note by entering a title and content. View existing notes, including their titles and content. Update a note by editing its title or content. Delete a note by selecting the delete option. The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface for managing your notes effectively.

Feel free to clone the repository, explore the code, and use it as a starting point for your own projects.
